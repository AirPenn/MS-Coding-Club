If you need any help:
```c++
if( (your_location == the_library) && (day_of_week == friday) && (time == between_threePM_and_fourPM) )
{
  Ask(Me);
}
if (where_you_arent_at == coding_club)
{
  ShameOn(You);
  Cry();
  Email(Me);
}
```
```
A: First you'll need to make a GitHub account.  
      1) Click that green button that says "Sign Up" (top left).  
      2) Input a username that does not contain your name.  
      3) Input a secure password.  Not sure what secure means?  Check how long it would take me to crack your password at <a href="http://calc.opensecurityresearch.com/">http://calc.opensecurityresearch.com/</a>.  Use 'PHPS' as the Keys Per Second.  
      4) Input either your school or personal email address.  GitHub only sent me an email once, so no need to be worried about spam.  
B: So you've made an account? Great!
