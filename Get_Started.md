Get Started!
A: First you'll need to make a GitHub account.  
      1) Click that green button that says "Sign Up" (top left).  
      2) Input a username that does not contain your name.  
      3) Input a secure password.  Not sure what secure means?  Check how long it would take me to crack your password at <a href="http://calc.opensecurityresearch.com/">http://calc.opensecurityresearch.com/</a>.  Use 'PHPS' as the Keys Per Second.  
      4) Input either your school or personal email address.  GitHub only sent me an email once, so no need to be worried about spam.  
      5) Click the "Create Account" button.
      6) You will be taken to a choice of 'plans'.  Make sure the free one is selected.
      7) Click the "Finish Sign Up" button.  You've made an account!
B: So you've made an account? Great!  Tell me your username so I can add you to the repo.
C: Create Your Code Folder!  This is where you can keep any code you're working on.
      1) Navigate to the repo, and click the '+' next to the MS-Coding-Club.
      2) In the text box next to "MS-Coding-Club/", type your username, then type "/" (box will change), then type "README.md"
      3) In the text area below type in some sample text.  You can edit it later.
      4) Click the 'Commit New File' button at the bottom.  Congrats!  You've made your code folder.
D: Please read the 'Important Things' below.  They're important.
```
```
Important Things:
  1) Do NOT use your real name on GitHub for anything.  Do NOT refer to our school's name on GitHub for anything.  Why? Because I'd rather spend my Friday afternoons at Coding Club than in detention.
  2) Code Folders are for code.  I like code.  Folders like code.  Make us happy.
  3) No 'Five Nights at Freddys'.  That stuff freaks me out.  Oh, and no Comic Sans.  Just as bad.
  4) REMEMBER: The NSA is constantly monitoring anything you put on the internet.  Wouldn't it be a shame when you're running for President and 'that post' is the headline on CNN?
  5) Legal Note: All code in here is under no liscence, therefore there is no blanket liscence or copyright, meaning that, you could, in theory, put a copyright on your code, but that would violate Important Thing #1, so if there's anything so important to you that you want to copyright it, make a different account and post it there.
```
```
Files:
1) HTML Files end in '.html'.  filename.html
2) CSS Files end in '.css'.  filename.css
3) JavaScript Files end in '.js'.  filename.js
4) Markdown Files end in '.md'.  filename.md
5) Text Files end in '.txt'.  filename.txt
To create a file, enter a folder, click the plus, paste in your code, and commit your changes!
