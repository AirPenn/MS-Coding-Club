This is a simple concept.  It's just one of those things you need to remember.

Take these four HTML 'statements':
```html
1: <h1 style="color:#00B;">
2: <input type="text" disabled>
3: <body bgcolor="chucknorris">
4: <iframe>
```
In statement 1, the tag is 'h1', and the attribute is 'style'.
In statement 2, the tag is 'input', and the attributes are 'type' and 'disabled'.  An attribute does not necessarily need to have the equals sign and quotes, but most do.  The most common name-only attributes are 'required' and 'disabled'.
In statement 3, the tag is 'body', and the attribute is 'bgcolor'.  Note: even though this is valid code and will work, it is considered best practice to use CSS style.  And even though it is hilarious, if your boss sees that you put this on the website, you will be fired.
In statement 4, the tag is 'iframe', and there are no attributes.

EDIT: On this page, the tag is green while the attribute is pale blue.

Format of HTML statement:
```
<tag_name [possible_attributes]>
```

That's it.  It's that simple.  Just remember this terminology and life will become so much easier.
