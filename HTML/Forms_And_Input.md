First, let's quickly go over one really basic thing about the internet.  When you visit a website, your computer asks another computer (the other computer is called a server) for the data.  This communication is usually done through **HTTP** - **H**yper **T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol

There are two or three principle ways that a web page can allow a user to talk with the server.  Two of them use JavaScript, so if you are still learning HTML, then you don't have to consider them yet.

Forms are HTML's way of taking a user's input and sending it to the server.
