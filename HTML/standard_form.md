<strong>The Standard Form of HTML5!</strong>  
This is the most basic HTML document, and is necessary for each and every one:  
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

You should commit this to memory, as every single time you create an HTML Document.  

And remember to indent!
